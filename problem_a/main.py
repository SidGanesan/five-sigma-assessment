"""
At a concert, there are 100 seats numbered 1-100 and 100 tickets also numbered
1-100. Due to social distancing measures, members of the audience are only
allowed in one at a time, in ticket order starting from ticket 1, and must sit
in the seat with the same number as is on their ticket. However the first
member of the audience has had a few too many drinks and sits in a random seat.
Further audience members will sit in the seat on their ticket if it is free,
but if it is taken they will panic and also sit in a random seat

1. Write a function to simulate audience members taking their seats

2. Use monte carlo simulation to measure the probability (from e.g. 1000
simulations) that the person with the last ticket (ticket 100) gets to sit in
their own seat (seat 100).Â  (The true probability is 0.5 so make sure your
implementation matches up!)

3. For when we have our follow-up discussion/interview: think about the
computational complexity of your implementation (i.e. big O notation). Can you
think of any alternative algorithms that would significantly reduce
computational complexity? No additional code is needed for this step.
